/**
 * 
 * Implement this interface to describe a Move in your game.<br>
 * A typical implementation for a Chess game would be :
 * <ul>
 * <li>The color of the piece</li>
 * <li>The type of the piece (king, queen, pawn, ...)</li>
 * <li>The position before the move</li>
 * <li>The position after the move</li>
 * </ul>
 * Additional information might be necessary to implement the abstract {@link Minimax#unmakeMove(Move)} method of the {@link Minimax} class :
 * <ul>
 * <li>Taken pieces</li>
 * <li>...</li>
 * </ul>
